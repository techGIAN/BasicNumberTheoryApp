A simple application, runnable through a command prompt, that demos basic number theory concepts. It includes: <br />
- Remainder when one number is divided by the other (using integer modulo) <br />
- Prime and Co-Prime Tests <br />
- Prime Factorization <br />
- Highest Common Factor and Least Common Multiple <br />
- Modular Exponentiation (Coming Soon!) <br />
- Goldbach's Conjecture (Coming Soon!) <br />

Other Notes:
- Navigate through the "src" folder and then "numbertheoryapp". <br />
- To run NumberTheoryApp.java, compile it first in the command prompt. Type "javac NumberTheoryApp.java" and then type "java NumberTheoryApp" to run it.
